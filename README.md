# TeslaChallenge
Received a coding challenge from a software company as an interview screening, the task is pretty self-explanatory from the description. 
Only problem was that I failed to apply OOP concepts efficiently and failed the attempt. Decided to upload the code with the changes I made thus far so I could get feedback on where I might have gone wrong. 
Please feel free to comment and let me know how much I suck at this. :D
